excerpt: '\emph{Maximal ancestral graph} (MAGs) is a class of graphical model that extend the famous \emph{directed acyclic graph} in the presence of latent confounders. Most score-based approaches to learn the unknown MAG from empirical data rely on BIC score which suffers from instability and heavy computations. We propose to use the framework of imsets \citep{studeny2006probabilistic} to score MAGs using empirical entropy estimation and the newly proposed \emph{refined Markov property} \citep{hu2023towards}.
