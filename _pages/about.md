I am a postdoc at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam supervised by Stephanie van der Pas. Before that I obtained my PhD at the University of Oxford in Statistics supervised by Professor Robin Evans. I also did my master and bachelor in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Oxford.

My current research interest lie in data fusion, graphical model and causal inference. I currently work on combining estimators.

Software for published work can be found on my [[github page](https://github.com/zhongyi960403)].

My résumé is available [[here](https://zhongyi960403.github.io/files/CV_ZYH.pdf)].
