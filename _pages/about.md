I am a final year PhD student at the University of Oxford in Statistics supervised by Professor Robin Evans. Before my PhD, I did my master and bachelor in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Oxford.

My current research interests lie at graphical model and causal inference. I am particularly interested in theoretical properties of maximal ancestral graphs, which is an extension of the well-known directed acyclic graphs(DAGs), as well as developing score-based methods for learning causal graphs in the presence of latent confounders. 

Software for published work can be found on my [[github page](https://github.com/zhongyi960403)].

My résumé is available [[here](https://zhongyi960403.github.io/files/CV_ZYH.pdf)].
